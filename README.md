- 👋 Hi, I’m Shekhar Suman.
- 👀 I’m experienced in Java programming language and the underlying environment, Linux OS (CentOS / Fedora), and the system administration stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring Python and distributed programming concepts. Planning to start Rust programming in some time to gain systems programming experience.
- 💞️ Always ready to learn and adopt new things. I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting project, though I spend a significant amount of my time on Stack Overflow 
      (learning / commenting / answering rarely - in that order)
- 📫 How to reach me ... kindly connect with me on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/shekharsuman93)!
